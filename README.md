This package transforms seismic time series into scattering coefficients with a scattering network. __ScatSeisNet__ + its documentation is under construction, likely release date will be around April 2023. For now you can install the package with the following command:

```pip install -e . ```

There are some tutorials in the `notebooks` folder.

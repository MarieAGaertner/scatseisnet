Rationale
---------

In the recent years, we worked on a scattering network for seismic time series data, mainly for data exploration task involving dimensionality reduction and clustering.
We have seen an increasing interest in the seismological community for this kind of approach, and decided to make the code available to the community.
This package delivers the network instance and in the tutorials we introduce the scattering network together with some data exploration applications.
Please note that the task and data at hand drive the choice of the exact design of the scattering network and the tools used for data exploration.
The following papers show some possible applications and we hope that they can inspire you for your specific use case. 
If you use this package for your own scientific output, please cite one or more
of the following papers.

Tutorials
=========

These series of notebook-based tutorials are designed to introduce the reader to the basic concepts of the scatterings networks, the scatseisnet package and its applications in seismology. The tutorials are designed to be read in order, and are intended to be self-contained. The reader is assumed to have a basic understanding of machine learning and signal processing. If you find any errors or have any suggestions for improvement, please open an issue on the github repository, or contact us directly. 



.. note::

   The tutorials are designed to be run in a Jupyter notebook environment. If you are unfamiliar with Jupyter notebooks, please see the `Jupyter documentation <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ for more information.

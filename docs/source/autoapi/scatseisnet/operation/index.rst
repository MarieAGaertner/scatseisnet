.. py:function:: segment(x: numpy.ndarray, window_size: int, stride: Union[int, None] = None) -> Generator[numpy.ndarray, None, None]

   
   Segment array into overlapping windows.

   :param x: Array to segment.
   :type x: :class:`numpy.ndarray`
   :param window_size: Sliding window size in numpy of points
   :type window_size: int
   :param stride: Sliding window stride in numpy of points. If None, stride is equal to
                  window_size.
   :type stride: int, optional

   :Yields: *The elements of the segmented array.*

.. py:function:: segmentize(x: numpy.ndarray, window_size: int, stride: Union[int, None] = None) -> numpy.ndarray

   
   Segment array into overlapping windows.

   :param x: Array to segment.
   :type x: :class:`numpy.ndarray`
   :param window_size: Sliding window size in numpy of points
   :type window_size: int
   :param stride: Sliding window stride in numpy of points. If None, stride is equal to
                  window_size.
   :type stride: int, optional

   :rtype: The segmented array with shape ``(n_windows, n_channels, n_times)``.

.. py:function:: pool(x: numpy.ndarray, reduce_type: Union[Callable, None] = None) -> numpy.ndarray

   
   Pooling operation performed on the last axis.

   :param x: The input data to pool.
   :type x: :class:`numpy.ndarray`
   :param reduce_type: The reducing operation (e.g. :func:`numpy.mean()`). If None, no
                       operation is performed.
   :type reduce_type: callable, optional

   :returns: **pooled** -- The data pooled with same shape of input data minus last dimension.
   :rtype: :class:`numpy.ndarray`

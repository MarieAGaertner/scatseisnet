.. py:function:: gaussian_window(x: cupy.ndarray, width: Union[float, Sequence[float], cupy.ndarray]) -> cupy.ndarray

   
   Gaussian function.

   This function can generate a bank of windows at once if the width
   argument is a vector (and/or amplitude). In this case, it should have
   a new axis with respect to the time vector to allow for outer product.

   :param x: Input variable, in the same units than the width.
   :type x: :class:`numpy.ndarray` or :class:`cupy.ndarray`
   :param width: Window width (in the same units than the input variable). If an array
                 is provided, the function returns as many windows as the number of
                 elements of this parameter.
   :type width: float or np.ndarray
   :param amplitude: Window amplitude at maximum (default 1). If this parameter is a vector,
                     it should have the same number of elements than the width.
   :type amplitude: float or np.ndarray, optional

   :returns: The Gaussian window in the time domain. If the width (and possibly
             amplitude) argument is a vector, the function returns a matrix with
             shape (len(width), len(x)).
   :rtype: Same type as ``x``.

.. py:function:: complex_morlet(x: cupy.ndarray, center: Union[float, Sequence[float], cupy.ndarray], width: Union[float, Sequence[float], cupy.ndarray]) -> cupy.ndarray

   
   Complex Morlet wavelet.

   The complex Morlet wavelet is a complex plane wave modulated by a Gaussian
   window. The oscillatory frequency of the plane wave is the center frequency,
   and the temporal width of the Gaussian is the width argument.

   This function can generate a filter bank at once if the width and center
   arguments are vectors of the same size. In this case, they should have a new
   axis with respect to the time vector to allow for outer product.

   :param x: Time vector in seconds.
   :type x: :class:`numpy.ndarray` or :class:`cupy.ndarray`
   :param width: Temporal signal width in seconds.
   :type width: float or :class:`numpy.ndarray` or :class:`cupy.ndarray`.
   :param center: Center frequency in Hertz.
   :type center: float or :class:`numpy.ndarray` or :class:`cupy.ndarray`.

   :returns: The complex Mortlet wavelet in the time domain. If the center and width
             (and possibly amplitude) arguments are vectors, the function returns a
             matrix with shape ``(len(width), len(x))``.
   :rtype: Same type as ``x``.

      Compute the scalogram for a given segment.

      :param segment: The segment to be transformed of shape ``(..., channels, bins)``. The
                      number of bins should be the same as the number of bins of the
                      filter bank.
      :type segment: :class:`numpy.ndarray`

      :returns: **scalogram** -- The scalograms for all channels with shape (the ellipsis stands for
                unknown number of input dimensions)
                `n_channels, ..., n_filters, n_bins`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    layer_kwargs: :class:`list` of :class:`dict`
        The keyword argiments of each filter bank keyword arguments, in the form
        of a :class:`list`. Each :class:`dict` object contains the keyword
        arguments for the :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank`. The number of network
        layers is defined by the length of this list. Please see the
        :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank` documentation for more information about
        the keyword arguments.
    bins: :class:`int`, optional
        Number of time samples per signal windows. By default, this value is
        128. Note that once set, the value cannot be changed.
    sampling_rate: :class:`float`, optional
        Input data sampling rate in Hertz. This is useful to keep track of
        physical frequencies in the filterbanks properties. The default value is
        1.0 (reduced frequency).

    Attributes
    ----------
    banks: :class:`list` of :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank`
        Filter banks of the scattering network. The length of this list is equal
        to the number of layers of the scattering network. Each filter bank is
        an instance of the :class:`~.ComplexMorletBank` class.
    sampling_rate: float
        Input data sampling rate in Hertz.
